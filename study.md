## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  I just drew a wireframe in my notebook.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
--  individual game will be stored in JSON.  each player's info will be stored
in an object-like model represented in json.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-- i will make 9 div's and id each one individually.  with a little fancy, pancy HTMl
and CSS, I will use jQuery to toggle between classes on the game board when a div is clicked.
i also plan on using some kind of jquery function after each on click / toggle class to check if there is a winning combination in 3 of any direction.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
I plan on approaching this project methodically, baby step by step and to verify each step to make sure i can keep building this project
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.

as a player, I want this game to work so that it'll be fun to beat my opponent
as a player, i want simplicity... life is so just complicated, that i want to easily sign in and start playing ASAP
as a player, I want something visually well organized so that I don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out to play this game
as a player, i want to be able to change my password so that my sneaky little kid brother doesn't ruin my perfect record of wins in TICTACTOE

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
there's a balance between keeping code modular and also between just getting a working product.  main objective here is to get a working project.  while we do want to keep our code organized in a modular fashion, we also want to optimize the speed of testing code to get a properly wired backend

    What creative spin will you add to your project.
Initially, not much.  again, i want to get a working project first, then i'll add some creative spin to it.  let's say my creative spin will be how utterly minimalistic my projet will be.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
 i will be GitHubbing the fuck out of this project.  i actually already started making my tic tac toe board and gaming functions and with about 5 hours of coding work, i think i have at least 6 commits.  each commit has a detailed message and it's fucking sweet to look at my code history in github seeing the differences in code between each commit.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
if i have time.  again, i want to get a working project before i go all fancy, smancy, artistic on this tic tac toe project.
